# Tables on testing GR and theories beyond GR.

These tables were born in the review article, Berti et al. (2015), _Testing General Relativity With Present and Future Astrophysical Observations_, [Class. Quantum Grav. **32** 243001](http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/0264-9381/32/24/243001)  [[arXiv:1501.07274](https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.07274)] as Tables 1, 2, and 3.  These were static LaTeX tables, and as this field is rapidly evolving, were soon out of date.

This repo is trying to keep them up to date, in a more uniform and both human- and computer-readable format, as dynamic web pages.

## Web page
The tables are currently hosted at https://duetosymmetry.com/testing-gr-tables/ (on Leo's web site).
